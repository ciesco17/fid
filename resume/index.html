<h3>About Me</h3>
<p style="color:#cce3de;">   Interestingly enough, my interest for graphic design was birthed while graduating high school in the midst of a global pandemic. What started off as simply creating encouraging content for people on social media during a discouraging time, grew a passion for utilizing my design skills and social media to reach others.<br>
</br>During my education at Seminole State College I've earned a Technical Certificate as a Graphic Design Content Developer and will be graduating in 2024 with an A.S. Degree in Graphic Design Specialization. My degree includes, but is not limited to: <em>image-making, color correction, typography, print publishing, illustration, web design, research, portfolio development, publishing, advertising, branding, packaging, information design, as well as design for the World Wide Web and other digital devices.</em><br>
</br>It's been amazing being able to apply the skills and knowledge I've learned along the way to my freelance work and the ministry. Although my participation and involvement with the ministry and their social media began a couple years before, the beginning of my journey as a Campus Missionary Intern with Every Nation Ministries at Lake Mary Church started in 2022. Part of my role has been creating designs, such as flyers, social media and stationary graphics, and promotional material. Special opportunities I will always remember was creating the design and promotional material for our High School Youth Summit in 2023, as well as creating the sermon slides for the biggest yearly conference our student ministry has, called Breakthrough, in 2022 where about 600 college and highschool students gathered.<br>
</br>I've learned so much from experienced Multimedia Designers that I have the privilege of working beside. With their leadership I now lead and oversee a team of other gifted students who feel called create to content that will reach other students in a similar way. Now, I'm looking to apply all of the knowledge and skills I've gained to other businesses and organizations to help them thrive!
